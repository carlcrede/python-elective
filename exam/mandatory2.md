# Exam Synopsis

## 1. Data Structures & functions
Ideas for presentation:
1) Focus on files - I will show how to read and write textfiles in a couple of ways, and how to read a file into a list. Then I will demonstrate how to use some built-in functions on the list, eg. sorted and len. 
If there is time I will also loop through the list and demonstrate the use of range and print.

2) Focus on functions - I will show how to create a simple function definition, how to give it parameters and how to return values. Also I will give an example of how to decorate a function with a simple timer.

## 2. Pythonic OOP
Ideas for presentation:
1) Focus on the python datamodel 'dunder'/magic methods - I will give examples of how we can implement different dunder-methods such as __len__, __repr__, __str__, __add__ etc for some class.

## 3. Generators, Decorators & Context Managers 
Ideas for presentation:
1) Focus on generator and decorator - I will make a function that returns a list of size n and a generator function that also constructs a list of size n - then I will make a timer decorator function and then decorate
the two functions to see their time difference.

## 4. Python modules and the python development environment. 
Presentation ideas:
1) Focus on modules - I will demonstrate how to install and use a 3rd party module (probably requests) and then I will demonstrate how to use some built-in modules (eg. time, random, os, subprocess).

2) Focus on developement environment - I will demonstrate how to run a .py file in the terminal and how to use the REPL. Then I will show how to run python in a docker container. If there is time I will also demonstrate how to run a jupyter notebook.
